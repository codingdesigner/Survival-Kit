/* The Coding Designer's Survival Kit 
  A framework for designing websites in the browser. 
  
  Much love to:
  Sass, Compass, HTML5 Boilerplate, Modernizr, Formalize, and more

// Chapter I: INTRODUCTION
  This is the central organizing sass file where we manage all the imported partials 
  in The Kit. Don't write custom code here. Instead, import files that bring in
  default code from The Kit and files that add your custom code. The checklist below
  should help you put these files in order. 
  
  The partials are split into two containing folders: 
  "kit_partials" contains partials that you shouldn't alter. Leaving these
  alone will make upgrading The Kit much easier in the future. 
  "my_partials" contains all the custom alterations and original sass code
  you write for your project. See below for details.
  
  
// Chapter II: IMPORTS THAT DON'T ADD CODE  
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Start by importing a number of set up sass partials. The imported partials
  in the first few steps will not add any css to the compiled css. They 
  merely establish variables and helper mixins that will help later 
  in the process. 
  

// ✔ 1. VARIABLES
  Set up variables for future use.
  First we import the kit's default colors, which contains all the named 
  CSS values as variables. This makes quickly blocking our generic colors
  very easy. 
@import kit_partials/variables/colors
// Then you can add your own custom color variables to your own colors partial.
@import my_partials/variables/colors
// The Kit fonts partial establishes variables for simple clean typography
@import kit_partials/variables/fonts
// Declare your own font variables here.
@import my_partials/variables/fonts
// Import general starter variables from The Kit
@import kit_partials/variables/base
// Uncomment below to use custom base values
// @import kit_partials/variables/base

// ✔ 2. COMPASS MIXINS
  Add the compass tools you need
// all of compass
@import compass
// or individual compass components, if you're into the whole brevity thing
// @import compass/css3
// @import compass/layout
// @import compass/support
// @import compass/typography
// @import compass/utilities


// Chapter III: IMPORTS THAT DO ADD CODE
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  These imported partials will start adding css when compiled. Starting with 
  your choice of CSS reset.
  
  
// ✔ 3. PICK A CSS RESET
  There are subtle differences and approaches with the following CSS resets. 
  Eric Meyer is set by default, but the others are worth trying. 
/* CSS RESET  
// Eric Meyer reset
@import kit_partials/reset/_meyer-reset
// html5 boilerplate reset
// @import partials/boilerplate/_boilerplate-reset
// compass reset
// @import compass/reset
// susy reset
// @import susy/reset

// ✔ 4. CHOOSE A GRID FRAMEWORK
  Compass comes with Blueprint, and plenty of documentation
  (http://compass-style.org/reference/blueprint/)
// Set some variables commonly used by most grid systems
@import kit_partials/grids/_grids-all.sass
// @import my_partials/grids/_grids-all.sass
// BLUEPRINT
// @import blueprint/grid
// @import kit_partials/grids/_grids-blueprint.sass
// @import my_partials/grids/_grids-blueprint.sass
// alternately, import all of blueprint - use caution
// @import blueprint
// SUSY
  You may want to try Susy (http://susy.oddbird.net/), which 
  is designed to work closely with Compass.
@import kit_partials/grids/_grids-susy.sass


// Chapter IV: IMPORTS THAT SAVE TIME AND TROUBLE
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  From button styles to better link styles. Use the following imports to 
  add tools that automate different tasks


// ✔ 5. COMPASS PLUG-INS
// Fancy Buttons
// @import fancy-buttons
// Sassy Buttons
// @import sassybuttons
  
// ✔ 6. ADD HELPER MIXINS
  Over time I've collected or written a number of useful mixins. 
@import kit_partials/mixins/helpers
@import kit_partials/mixins/layout
@import kit_partials/mixins/typography
// @import kit_partials/mixins/ui
// @import kit_partials/mixins/sfx


// Chapter V: IMPORTS THAT SET DEFAULTS FOR YOUR PROJECT
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  The following imports set default styles for most standard elements in a site. 

// ✔ 7. DEFAULTS
  Set your overall site defaults. This covers mostly high level typographic items
@import kit_partials/defaults/_defaults
// @import partials/boilerplate/_boilerplate-setup
// @import partials/boilerplate/_boilerplate-helpers
// Set defaults for most HTML elements
@import kit_partials/defaults/_elements


// Chapter VI: IMPORTS THAT YOU DON'T NEED
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  At least you won't need them in production. They help give you some structure
  while you design, or mimic styles from your CMS

// ✔ 8. Styles just for working in the Survival Kit
  REMOVE THESE IN PRODUCTION
  These are styles designed for use by The Kit
@import kit_partials/survival_kit/_survival-kit


// ✔ 9. CMS-specific overrides and mixins
  These add in some of the default styles from your CMS. 
  They may be REMOVED IN PRODUCTION with caution
// DRUPAL
// @import kit_partials/cms/drupal/drupal-helpers


// Chapter VII: HERE IS WHERE YOU DO YOUR MAIN WORK
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  With all the defaults set up, now you can get to work on your own design. 
  
  
// ✔ 10. STYLES FOR THIS SITE --------------------------------------------------
  Create your layout in a separate file from your design details
@import _layout.sass
@import _design.sass


// Chapter VIII: MAKE ADJUSTMENTS FOR DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND CAPABILITIES
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Now set up your responsive layout, and use modernizr and ie classes to 
  adjust for less-capable systems

// ✔ 11. RESPONSIVE --------------------------------------------------
  Create layouts for a number of device-size breakpoints
// @import kit_partials/media/_responsive.sass

// ✔ 12. Modernizr & Browser Support -------------------------------------------
  Use modernizr (http://modernizr.com) to manage styles for less-capable devices
  Use IE classes on the <html> tag to manage classes for different IE browsers
// @import kit_partials/browser_adjustments/_modernizr.sass
// @import kit_partials/browser_adjustments/_ie.sass


// ✔ 13. Print -------------------------------------------
  Add print styles via @media query rather than by it's own stylesheet
// @import kit_partials/print
