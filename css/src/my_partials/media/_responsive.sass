// HOW TO USE THIS FILE: 
  The Coding Designer's Survival Kit includes a basic @media skeleton over in 
  "kit_partials/media/_responsive.sass"
  OPTION A: Use and alter those styles as you see fit. 
    This is simpler, however you won't be able to upgrade the kit without overriding your styles
  OPTION B: Copy those styles to this file, and point "style.sass (step # 11)" to this file instead
